## Exercise 2.76

### Comparison of Generic Operation Strategies

- Explicit dispatch - all generic operations must be redefined to handle a new type introduced. A new operation must be a new generic procedure handling all existing types within the system.

- Data-directed style - when a new type is added, we must add a new "package" that implements the generic operations for that type. We don't need to modify existing procedures. If we add a new operation, we might modify existing packages to implement the operation for each existing type.

- Message-passing style - when a new type is added, we add an "intelligent data object" which handles all operations for that type. A new operation however must be added to all the type definitions.

### Handling Frequent New Types

If new types are often added, data-directed or message-passing style are better. We don't need to modify existing procedures.

### Handling Frequent New Operations

If new operations are often added, data-directed is better, explicit dispatch is OK but not as lightweight for defining the generic operation. Message-passing requires reimplementation of the existing types.
