## Exercise 2.44

Full script available as `resources/2-44.scm` so this ran be reproduced in _DrRacket *_.

### Solution

``` Scheme
(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
        (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))
```

### Tests

``` Scheme
(paint (up-split wave 4))
(paint (up-split einstein 4))
```

![(paint (up-split wave 4))](img/2-44A.png)
![(paint (up-split wave 4))](img/2-44C.png)

``` Scheme
(paint (corner-split wave 4))
(paint (corner-split einstein 4))
```

![(paint (corner-split wave 4))](img/2-44B.png)
![(paint (corner-split wave 4))](img/2-44D.png)
