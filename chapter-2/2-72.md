## Exercise 2.72

Considering the special case in exercise 2.71, there are $n-1$ levels of the tree for $n$ symbols. 

My implementation of `encode-symbol` firstly does a search that the symbol exists in the $n$ symbols. It then searches the left branch subtree for the symbol. The size of the left branch reduces at each levels as $n-1, n-2, ..., 1$. 

On average it will need to search $(n-1)/2$ symbols for each left branch subtree of $n-2$ nodes (the last two nodes being leaves), plus searching the $n$ symbols at the beginning. 

Multiplying these number of steps will gives us $O(n^2)$.

But this is the worst case. If we searched the right branch subtree instead, which always has one leaf, or we swapped the configuration of the tree round so the left branch always has one leaf instead of the right, the steps required at each node would be $O(1)$ for a tree depth $O(n)$. So the order of growth overall would be $O(n)$.

A balanced Huffman tree should have $O(\log{n})$.
