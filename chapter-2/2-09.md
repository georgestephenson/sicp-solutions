## Exercise 2.9

### Part A - Show Width of Sum is a Function of Widths being Added

The width of any interval $[a,A]$ can be expressed $(A-a)/2$

If $[b,B]$ is added to this interval, we know using Alyssa's reasoning that the resulting interval is

$$
[a+b,A+B]
$$

Applying our first rule, for the width of any interval, we get

$$
\frac{(A+B)-(a+b)}2 = \frac{(A-a)+(B-b)}2
$$

This is the same as adding the widths of both intervals.

If $[b,B]$ is subtracted from $[a,A]$, we know from Exercise 2.8 that the resulting interval is

$$
[a-B,A-b]
$$

Applying our first rule, for the width of any interval, we get

$$
\frac{(A-b)-(a-B)}2 = \frac{(A-a)+(B-b)}2
$$

This is also the same as adding the widths of both intervals.

### Part B - Examples Showing Width of Multiplication and Division Intervals are not Functions of Widths of Operands

We can test it by setting $a$ to different intervals and $b$ to different intervals but always having the same width for $a$ and same width for $b$.

We can see the width of the results are not equivalent in this case so are not functions only of the widths of $a$ and $b$.
