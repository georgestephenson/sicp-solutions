## Exercise 2.81

### Part A

If `apply-generic` is called with two arguments of type `scheme-number` or two arguments of type `complex` for an operation that is not found in the table, we will get an infinite loop of recursive calls to `apply-generic`.

In the example given, if we call `exp` with two complex numbers then we will not find a `proc`. `apply-generic` will then attempt coercion, finding `complex->complex`. This will recursively call `apply-generic` again with the same input arguments, and so we have an infinite loop.

### Part B

As it stands, `apply-generic` will look for coercion with arguments of the same type, if it does not find `proc`. It should fail to find such a coercion, as it doesn't make sense to have one, and return the error `"No method for these types"`. So the procedure works, but the check for coercion of two arguments of the same type is not necessary, and is vulnerable to break the procedure if someone like Louis adds this coercion.

### Part C

``` Scheme
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (if (= (length args) 2)
              (let ((type1 (car type-tags))
                    (type2 (cadr type-tags))
                    (a1 (car args))
                    (a2 (cadr args)))
                (if (eq? type1 type2)
                    (error "No method for these types"
                      (list op type-tags))
                (let ((t1->t2 (get-coercion type1 type2))
                      (t2->t1 (get-coercion type2 type1)))
                  (cond (t1->t2
                         (apply-generic op (t1->t2 a1) a2))
                        (t2->t1
                         (apply-generic op a1 (t2->t1 a2)))
                        (else
                         (error "No method for these types"
                                (list op type-tags)))))))
              (error "No method for these types"
                     (list op type-tags)))))))
```
