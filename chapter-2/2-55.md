## Exercise 2.55

``` Scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

This expression is equivalent to writing

``` Scheme
(car '(quote abracadabra))
```

Which is the same as the representation of a list of symbols, the symbols being `quote` and `abracadabra`.

This will return the `car` of the list of symbols `'(quote abracadabra)` which will be `quote`.
