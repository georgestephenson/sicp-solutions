## Exercise 2.22

### Part A - First Version of `square-list`

``` Scheme
(define nil '())
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things) 
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
;Value: (16 9 4 1)
```

Louis Reasoner's first iterative version of `square-list` iterates through `items`, starting at the beginning of the list, but adds each item to the end of `answer`. In other words it iterates through `items` forwards but `answer` backwards.

### Part A - Second Version of `square-list`

``` Scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
;Value: ((((() . 1) . 4) . 9) . 16)
```

The second version does not meet the correct construction of a list which must include an empty list in the final pair's `cdr`.

As show by the result above, the empty list `nil` that passed to `iter` at the beginning becomes the `car` of the first pair of `answer`, which results in the unusual construction of pairs displayed.
