# Exercise 4.65

``` Scheme
(rule (wheel ?person)
      (and (supervisor ?middle-manager ?person)
           (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))
```

The query in the rule `wheel` will find all matches where:

- The given person `?person` is a supervisor of `?middle-manager`,
- and `?middle-manager` is a supervisor of someone else.

We will get a query result for each possible combination of these matches:

- Oliver Warbucks supervises Eben Scrooge who supervises Robert Cratchet
- Ben Bitdiddle supervises Alyssa P. Hacker who supervises Louis Reasoner
- Oliver Warbucks supervises Ben Bitdiddle who supervises Alyssa P. Hacker
- Oliver Warbucks supervises Ben Bitdiddle who supervises Cy D. Fect
- Oliver Warbucks supervises Ben Bitdiddle who supervises Lem E. Tweakit

Hence Oliver Warbucks is listed as a "wheel" four times, and Ben Bitdiddle once.
