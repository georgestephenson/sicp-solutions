# Exercise 4.71

If the streams are not delayed, then there are example when the recursive calls will loop forever before returning anything:

``` Scheme
(assert! (friends Bill Ben))

(assert! (rule (friends ?x ?y)
               (friends ?y ?x)))

(friends ?x ?y)
```

The standard query evaluator driver loop will repeat this output forever, which at least informs on what's happening:

``` Scheme
(friends ben bill)
(friends bill ben)
; ...
```

With Louis's version, it never returns any output. This is because the evaluator will try to eagerly evaluate the recursive calls in the streams.

Similarly with a `disjoin` on an infinite stream:

``` Scheme
(assert! (person Bill))
(assert! (person Ben))

(assert! (rule (people ?x)
               (or (person ?x)
                   (people ?x))))

(people ?x)
```

The standard query evaluator will print this infinitely:

``` Scheme
(people bill)
(people ben)
; ...
```

With Louis's version, it never returns any output.
