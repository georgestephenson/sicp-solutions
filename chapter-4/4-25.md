# Exercise 4.25

``` Scheme
(define (unless condition usual-value exceptional-value)
  (if condition exceptional-value usual-value))

(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
          1))

(factorial 5)
;Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

In applicative-order Scheme, the expression `(* n (factorial (- n 1)))` must be fully evaluated in each recursive call to `unless`. In turn, each call to `factorial` must call `unless`. This creates an infinite loop, as unlike `if`, `unless` is a standard procedure and not a special form that will leave the `usual-value` unevaluated if `unless`'s `condition` is not met.

In a normal-order language, `(factorial 5)` will evaluate successfully. The evaluator will build the following expression of primitives, before applying all of the arguments.

``` Scheme
(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))))
```
