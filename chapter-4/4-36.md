# Exercise 4.36

## Problem with replacing `an-integer-between` with `an-integer-starting-from`

If we were to implement the procedure to eventually generate all Pythagorean triples like this:

``` Scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (let ((i (an-integer-starting-from 1)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-starting-from i)))
      (let ((k (an-integer-starting-from j)))
        (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
        (list i j k)))))
```

The problem is that $i$ and $j$ will start with a value of $1$, and the evaluator will then search then search for all integers $k$ where $1^2 + 1^2 = k^2$, for which there are no solutions, and since $k$ has infinite possible values, it will search forever where $i=1, j=1$ and never backtrack from this.

## Solution

We don't have a mechanism to interleave the infinite ranges of $i$, $j$ and $k$ like we did in exercise 3.69. One solution is if we can rely on only one infinite range, $k$, and then $i$ and $j$ are bounded because they must be less than $k$ and therefore finite.

``` Scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple)
  (let ((k (an-integer-starting-from 1)))
    (let ((i (an-integer-between 1 k)))
      (let ((j (an-integer-between i k)))
        (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
        (list i j k)))))
