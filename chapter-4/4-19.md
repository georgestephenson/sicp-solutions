# Exercise 4.19

I support Eva's view because it is the most intuitive, desirable, and correct answer, while acknowledging that it is the most difficult to implement.

One way to implement internal definitions so that they behave as Eva prefers, would be to evaluate last any definitions whose right-hand side refers to other definitions within the same scope.

In this case, the definition of `(define a 5)` would be evaluated first, because `(define b (+ a x))` depends on the definition of `a`. That way we will get Eva's desired result for `b` which is 15.

Note that this doesn't work for cases of mutual recursion, as both would definitions would depend on each other in that case. Eva hasn't specified what should happen under mutual recursion at all. For mutual recursion, we are still stuck using either Ben's or Alyssa's solution: using sequential order or honouring the "simultaneous" scope rule and producing an error.

Note also that reordering the evaluation of definition based on their contents would have performance implications on an interpreter, which might be why the MIT implementation of Scheme doesn't do this.
