# Exercise 4.32

Having lazier lists would work well for selective evaluation, when using special forms like `if`, `and`, and `or`. 

For example, imagine two lists where every element is a delayed expensive computation. If you have two lists of the same length:

``` Scheme
(define (list-or l1 l2)
  (cons (or (car l1) (car l2))
        (list-or (cdr l1) (cdr l2))))
```

In this example `(car l2)` will never be evaluated if `(car l1)` is true. In the Chapter 3 stream, `(car l2)` would not be a delayed evaluation, it would already be a known value because the stream eagerly evaluates the `car`. In our lazier lists we can avoid evaluating any elements in `l2` at all if every element of `l1` is true.
