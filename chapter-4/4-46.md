# Exercise 4.46

The `parse` procedures rely on a left-to-right word order in order to parse different possible sentences because the `*unparsed*` words are processed left-to-right: words are taken from the front of the list, and the list is mutated. In `parse-sentence`, the noun phrase is parsed first, leaving the remaining words for the verb phrase. The process relies on the mutation of `*unparsed*` to have removed the noun phrase. Additionally, the use of `maybe-extend` will try to extend the end of phrases if it knows that the start of the sentence is valid, but that relies on parsing the prefix on the leftmost side first. We can't try to extend the phrase before we know there is a valid prefix to extend.
