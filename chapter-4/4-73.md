# Exercise 4.73

If `flatten-stream` uses `interleave` instead of `interleave-delayed`, it means that the `cadr` of the stream will be evaluated before the value is required.

The query system returns results incrementally and delays the `stream-cdr` explicitly for this reason.

It becomes more of an issue with infinite streams.
