# Exercise 4.7

The given `let*` expression:

``` Scheme
(let* ((x 3)
       (y (+ x 2))
       (z (+ x y 5)))
  (* x z))
```

Is equivalent to the following set of nested `let` expressions:

``` Scheme
(let ((x 3))
  (let ((y (+ x 2))
    (let ((z (+ x y 5)))
      (* x z)))))
```

I have defined `let*->nested-lets`

``` Scheme
(define (let*->nested-lets exp)
  (define (nest bindings body)
    (if (null? bindings) 
        body
        (cons 'let 
              (cons (list (car bindings)) 
                    (list (nest (cdr bindings) body))))))
  (let ((bindings (cadr exp))
        (body (caddr exp)))
    (nest bindings body)))
```

It was sufficient to add this clause to `eval`:

``` Scheme
((let*? exp) (eval (let*->nested-lets exp) env))
```

This is because using the solution to exercise 4.6, `let` is itself a derived expression, and deriving `let*` in terms of `let` makes it a derived expression also.
