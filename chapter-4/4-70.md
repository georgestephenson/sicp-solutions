# Exercise 4.70

In the case of `(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))`, this self-referencing stream is a way to purposefully create an infinite stream. The stream infinitely loops onto itself.

However, with the logic programming language's rules and assertions, self-referencing is something we want to avoid. We don't want `THE-ASSERTIONS` to be "consed" onto itself.  Using `let` forces evaluation of the existing stream to attach it to the new stream which includes the new assertion or rule being added.
