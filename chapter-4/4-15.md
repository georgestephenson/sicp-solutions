# Exercise 4.15

``` Scheme
(define (run-forever) (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))
```

Assume there exists a correct procedure `halts?` that returns true if and only if a procedure `p` halts on an object `a`.

If `(try try)` doesn't halt, and therefore `(halts? try try)` is false, in fact `(try try)` does halt if `(halts? try try)` is false, so it contradicts the result of `halts?`.

If `(try try)` does halt, and therefore `(halts? try try)` is true, in fact `(try try)` never halts and will run forever if `(halts? try try)` is true, so it also contradicts `halts?`.

Either boolean result of `halts?` will contradict the actual result of `(try try)`, so neither result of `halts?` can be correct: it is impossible to write a correct `halts?` procedure.
