# Exercise 4.37

Ben Bitdiddle's definition:

``` Scheme
(define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
  (let ((i (an-integer-between low high))
        (hsq (* high high)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
      (let ((ksq (+ (* i i) (* j j))))
        (require (>= hsq ksq))
        (let ((k (sqrt ksq)))
          (require (integer? k))
          (list i j k))))))
```

Ben Bitdiddle is right. The solution in exercise 4.35 will search basically every possible triple of integers in order to find solutions. It only enforces non-decreasing order.

Ben Bitdiddle's solution improves on this by only searching potential pairs of $i$ and $j$ and deriving $k$.

If we are searching triples, the number of triples grows with $O(n^3)$ of the range size $n$, whereas the number of pairs grows with $O(n^2)$ of the range size $n$. It is much better to search only pairs.
