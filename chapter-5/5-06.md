# Exercise 5.6

Within the `afterfib-n-1` subroutine:

```
 afterfib-n-1                         ; upon return, val contains Fib(n-1)
   (restore n)
   (restore continue)
   ;; set up to compute Fib(n-2)
   (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
   (save continue)
   (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
   (save val)                         ; save Fib(n-1)
   (goto (label fib-loop))
```

The value of `continue` is restored, saved, and reassigned again without ever reading the value that was restored. We can skip the restoring and saving entirely and rewrite like so:

```
 afterfib-n-1                         ; upon return, val contains Fib(n-1)
   (restore n)
   ;; set up to compute Fib(n-2)
   (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
   (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
   (save val)                         ; save Fib(n-1)
   (goto (label fib-loop))
```
