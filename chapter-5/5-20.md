# Exercise 5.20

``` Scheme
(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (list x x))
```

The box-and-pointer diagram for `y`:


```
y-*>|o|o|-->|o|/|
     |    x  v
     *----->|o|o|-->[2]
         x   v
            [1]
```

Memory-vector representation:

```
Index     0  1  2  3  4
the-cars |  |n1|p1|p1|  |
the-cdrs |  |n2|e0|p2|  |
```

The final value of free is p4.

The pointer 1 represents x.

The pointer 3 represents y.
