# Exercise 5.11

## Part A

In the original Fibonacci machine (figure 5.12), we assign n from val, then restore val:

``` Scheme
   (assign n (reg val))               ; n now contains Fib(n-2)
   (restore val)                      ; val now contains Fib(n-1)
   (restore continue)
   (assign val                        ; Fib(n-1)+Fib(n-2)
           (op +) (reg val) (reg n)) 
```

Instead we can restore n with the last value of val, and leave val where it is:

``` Scheme
   (restore n)                        ; n contains Fib(n-1), val contains Fib(n-2)
   (restore continue)
   (assign val                        ; Fib(n-2)+Fib(n-1)
           (op +) (reg val) (reg n)) 
```

This removes one instruction. It's slightly counter-intuitive because n and val have swapped values, but we still get the same result when assigning val to be val + n.
