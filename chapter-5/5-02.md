# Exercise 5.2

Using the register-machine language to describe the iterative factorial machine of exercise 5.1:

```
(controller
  test-counter
    (test (op >) (reg counter) (reg n))
    (branch (label iter-done))
    (assign product (op *) (reg counter) (reg product))
    (assign counter (op +) (reg counter) (const 1))
    (goto (label test-counter))
  iter-done)
```
