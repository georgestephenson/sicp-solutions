# SICP Solutions

These are my own solutions to the computer science textbook

>**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Second Edition**
>by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman

## Chapters
- [x] Chapter 1: Building Abstrations with Procedures
- [x] Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data
- [x] Chapter 3: Modularity, Objects, and State
- [x] Chapter 4: Metalinguistic Abstraction (except the final exercises 4.78 and 4.79)
- [ ] Chapter 5: Computing with Register Machines

## Tools

I am using [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), except:

>Section 2.2.4 Example: A Picture Language

Exercises 2.44 - 2.52. I used [Racket's SICP Picture Language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Picture_Language.html). Running it in DrRacket is the easiest way.

I wrote the exercises using a mix of Markdown `.md` and Scheme `.scm` files. If the exercise predominately requires code to be produced, I did it using a Scheme file. If the exercise requires a written explanation, I did it using a Markdown file. However, some exercises require both code and explanations, so there's no hard-and-fast rule for those. I might use comments in Scheme or code snippets in Markdown depending on the balance.

I wrote mathematical expressions using LaTeX format within Markdown. Most good Markdown renderers can display it.

I drew the diagrams using [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) and provide the .odg files, although maybe something like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) would be have been better.
