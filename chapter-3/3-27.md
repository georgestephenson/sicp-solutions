## Exercise 3.27

### Environment structure of `(memo-fib 3)`

This is somewhat simplified, but the main point is that `(memo-fib 1)` is called both by `(memo-fib 3)` and `(memo-fib 2)`. I have not represented the internal environment of `memoize`, but essentially the result of each `memo-fib` will be stored in a table and reused.
