## Exercise 3.27

### Environment structure of `(memo-fib 3)`

This is somewhat simplified, but the main point is that `(memo-fib 1)` is called both by `(memo-fib 3)` and `(memo-fib 2)`. I have not represented the internal environment of `memoize`, but essentially the result of each `memo-fib` will be stored in a table and reused.

*3.27 - Environment structure of `(memo-fib 3)`

This procedure computes the *n*th Fibonacci number $O(n)$ steps because `memo-fib` must only be computed $n+1$ times, from `(memo-fib n)` down to `(memo-fib 0)`. Any repeated calls to the same argument of `memo-fib` is simply read from the table.

If we had defined `memo-fib` to be `(memoize fib)`, this would only memoize the final result of the overall procedure. The recursive calls inside of `fib` would be directly to `fib` and not `memo-fib` so they would not be memoized.
