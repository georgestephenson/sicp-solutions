## Exercise 3.57

There are $n-1$ additions performed to compute the *n*th Fibonacci number where $n>1$, since every element after the first requires one addition.

We add `fib` to `(stream-cdr fib)` to get the next element. In other words,

$fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)$

With memoisation, $fib(n-2)$ and $fib(n-1)$ have already been cached, therefore there is only one addition for each new Fibonacci number.

Without memoisation, $fib(n-2)$ and $fib(n-1)$ are not cached. We need to recursively recalculate the Fibonacci number that make up these numbers, repeforming the additions, then add another addition. This recursive tree of calculations grows with roughly $O(2^n)$
