### Environment structure for sequence of expressions

Initially after defining `x` and `z`:

*3.20A - Environment structure after defining `x` and `z`*

*3.20B - Environment structure after `set-car!`

I note that the use of `set-car!` and `cdr` would create their own separate environments within the global environment. Likewise the user of `car` would create it's own environment in the global environment, and add an environment enclosed within E1 with the call to `dispatch` with `m: 'car`.
