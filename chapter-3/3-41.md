## Exercise 3.40

Serialising the dispatch procedure `'balance`, which should return the value of `balance`, would not have any effect if `balance` was a primitive number with one accessing step.

However, if `balance` was itself a procedure, it would be true that the events within the procedure could be interleaved unless the procedure is wrapped by such a call to `protected`.

Imagine for example that within a procedural `balance`, there is code to log the value of `balance` every time that it is accessed, similar to the `probe` in previous examples, and then return the value of `balance`. If the `balance` procedure was not serialised, it would be possible to interleave the procedure between the logging and the access of the value, thereby logging and returning different values.
