## Exercise 3.39

In the case given where $P_1$ is partially serialised:

`(lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))`

And $P_2$ is fully serialised: 

`(s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1))))`

The first two possible values, $101$ and $121$, are still possible even if the two events were fully serialised, and so they are also possible in this case.

It is still possible for $P_1$ to be interleaved between the accessing of `x` (twice) and the setting of `x`, since `set!` is not wrapped by the serialiser. So a value of $100$ is possible.

$P_2$ cannot be interleaved, so $11$ is not possible.

Due to the use of `(s (lambda () (* x x)))`, $P_1$ cannot be interleaved between the two times the value of x is accessed, and the evaluation of `(* x x)`. So a value of $110$ is not possible.

$101$, $121$ and $100$ are possible.
