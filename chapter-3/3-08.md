## Exercise 3.8

We can get different results evaluating `(+ (f 0) (f 1))` from left-to-right or from right-to-left by returning the operand the first time `f` is evaluated, and returning 0 otherwise. 

Using that definition of `f`: 
- Evaluating left-to-right will return 0 because `(f 0)` reads the operand as 0, and `(f 1)` ignores the operand and returns 0, therefore $0+0=0$.
- Evaluating right-to-left will return 1 because `(f 1)` reads the operand as 1, and `(f 0)` ignores the operand and returns 0, therefore $1+0=1$.

### Solution

``` Scheme
(define f
  (let ((used #f))
    (lambda (n)
      (if used
          0
          (begin (set! used #t)
                 n)))))
```
