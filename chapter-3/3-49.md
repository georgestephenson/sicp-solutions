## Exercise 3.49

The deadlock-avoidance mechanism would not work if we need to enter into a transaction and lock a resource before we know what the other shared resources are.

For example, what if we wanted to exchange an account with its linked account, but we can only find out what the linked account is by locking the initial account.

If two threads tried to exchange an account and its linked account at the same time, the two threads would:
- Firstly, concurrently lock both accounts. 
- Both threads would then both try to access the corresponding linked account. 
- Both thread would be unable to lock the corresponding account, as it is locked by the other thread.
- Both threads have entered a deadlock.
