# Exercise 3.68

Using Louis's definition of `pairs`, the recursive calls to `pairs` is evaluated immediately because `interleave` is evaluated immediately. `pairs` will be called indefinitely until we get the MIT Scheme error "maximum recursion depth exceeded".

In the original version, using `cons-stream` adds a delay to the evaluation of `interleave` so that the recursive call to `pairs` is also delayed for each element in the pairs stream. 

`cons-stream` is what enables lazy evaluation, as opposed to `cons`. Ordinarily parameters in MIT Scheme are eagerly evaluated.
