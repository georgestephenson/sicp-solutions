## Exercise 3.45

Within the call to `serialized-exchange` is the following procedure call:

``` Scheme
((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
  account1
  account2)
```

Within `exchange` there are calls to `'withdraw` and `'deposit`, which using Louis's new definitions, would call:

``` Scheme
(balance-serializer withdraw)
...
(balance-serializer deposit)
```

Each of these `balance-serializer` calls would be equivalent to `serializer1` and `serializer2` respectively, they are the same serializers. Calling the same serializer within a serializer will result in a circular dependency as each serialized procedure is waiting on the other procedure to finish. This is otherwise known as a deadlock that prevents the program from continuing further, and is a serious issue with the program.
