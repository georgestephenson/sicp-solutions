## Exercise 3.31

When `accept-action-procedure!` immediately runs the new action procedure, this initialization is necessary so that `probe` runs its `display` procedures when it's called initially.

``` Scheme
(probe 'sum sum)
(probe 'carry carry)
```

If we did not immediately call the `lambda` function within `probe`, these initial calls to `probe` would not display anything.

It is also the case that calling the procedure immediately will initialise the output signals based on the inputs, so that the output signal will correct itself. If we had called procedures in this order:

``` Scheme
(set-signal! input-1 1)
(propagate)
(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)
(propagate)
```

We would expect `sum` to correct itself to become 1 after a delay. If `half-adder` did not initialise the output, it would remain as 0 until we did another `set-signal!`.
