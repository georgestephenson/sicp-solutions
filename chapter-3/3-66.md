# Exercise 3.66

Each call to `interleave` will to alternate the first row of pairs with the remainder of the table of pairs.

Since (1,100) is in the first row, it's easier to reason about how many pairs precede it.

- The first pair is (1,1)
- The second pair is (1,2)
- Every further pair $(1,n)$ has an interleaved pair between it and $(1,n-1)$

For each pair $(1,n)$ where $n > 2$, there are $2n - 3$ preceding pairs.

So (1,100) has 197 preceding pairs.

It is more difficult to give precise mathematics about how many pairs precede (99,100) and (100,100). Each additional row of pairs introduces another level of recursive interleaving, so the delay grows longer with each additional row. To get to (99,99), which is the first pair in row 99, we need to introduce 98 levels of interleaving, and to get to (99,100) we need to wait much longer than we did to get to (1,100), even though it's the next pair in the row.

The pair $(n,n)$ is preceded by $2^n - 2$ pairs. For (100,100) this would be 1.2676506e+30 pairs.
