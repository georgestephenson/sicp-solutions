## Exercise 3.32

Procedures are called in FIFO (first in, first out) order to ensure they are computed in the same order in which they happen.

``` Scheme
(define a1 (make-wire))
(define a2 (make-wire))
(define res (make-wire))
(set-signal! a1 0)
(set-signal! a2 1)
(and-gate a1 a2 res)
(propagate) 
```

The value of `res` should start at `0`. If we then call:

``` Scheme
(set-signal! a1 1)
(set-signal! a2 0)
(propagate) 
```

Following FIFO, the first procedure `(set-signal! a1 1)` will set both inputs to `1` and so `res` will be 1. But we immediately call `(set-signal! a2 0)` after and `res` becomes `0` as both `a1` and `a2` are now `0`.

If we followed LIFO (last in, first out), then `(set-signal! a1 1)` would get called last, after `(set-signal! a2 0)`. At this intermediate point `res` had a result of `1`, which is incorrect, but LIFO order will give this as a final result.

Therefore, FIFO order is needed to ensure we get the correct final result of signal changes in our outputs.
