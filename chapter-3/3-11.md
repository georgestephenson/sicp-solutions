## Exercise 3.11

### Environment structure for sequence of interations

Given this sequence of interactions:

``` Scheme
(define acc (make-account 50))
((acc 'deposit) 40)
((acc 'withdraw) 60)
```

A summarised version of the environment structure is as follows:

*3.11A - Environment structure for Exercise 3.11*

Each call to `acc` calls `dispatch` which creates the environments E2 and E4 respectively. Dispatch then calls the right procedure, which for E3 and E5 is `deposit` and `withdraw` respectively. These are all enclosed within E1, the environment for `acc`.

### Defining another account

Suppose we define another account:

``` Scheme
(define acc2 (make-account 100))
```

This would create another environment under the global environment, containing the `balance` for `acc2`, and enclosing environments for any deposit/withdraw operations within `acc2`. It looks like a distinct copy of `acc` and our E1 environment and its sub-environments.

`acc` and `acc2` would create their own procedure objects and environment but they would however share the same code body.
