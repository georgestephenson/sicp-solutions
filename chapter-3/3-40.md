## Exercise 3.40

For the first example:

``` Scheme
(define x 10)
(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
```

There would be several interleaving possibilities. But the question only asks what possibilities remain if the procedures are fully serialised:

``` Scheme
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))
```

In this case the two procedures $P_1$ `(s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))` and $P_2$ `(s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))` must be sequential:

- If $P_1$ executes first, `x` becomes 100 and then 1000000.
- If $P_2$ executes first, `x` becomes 1000 and then 1000000.

The final value of `x` is the same although the intermediate value differs.
