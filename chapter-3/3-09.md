## Exercise 3.9

### Recursive version of `factorial`

Firstly, we add the `factorial` procedure object to the global environment.

To evaluate `(factorial 6)`, the call to `factorial` creates a new environment E1 where `n` is bound to the argument 6 and we evaluate the body of `factorial`:

``` Scheme
(if (= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))
```

The special operation `if` is evaluated, and the primitive subexpression `(= n 1)` is evaluated. Since `n` is not 1, we evaluate `(* n (factorial (- n 1)))`. We look for `factorial` in the first frame of E1, which contains no binding for `factorial`. We proceed to the global environment, finding the procedure, and create a new environment E2, binding `n` to the result of `(- 6 1)`, which is 5.

This continues recursively:

- E3 is bound to `n: 4` and the body of `factorial`
- E4 is bound to `n: 3` and the body of `factorial`
- E5 is bound to `n: 2` and the body of `factorial`
- E6 is bound to `n: 1` and the body of `factorial`

In E6 the `if` expression evaluates to 1 and so no more environments are required.

### Iterative version of `factorial`

Firstly, we add the `factorial` and `fact-iter` procedure objects to the global environment.

To evaluate `(factorial 6)`, the call to `factorial` creates a new environment E1 where `n` is bound to the argument 6 and we evaluate the body of `factorial`:

``` Scheme
(fact-iter 1 1 n)
```

E1 contains no binding for `fact-iter`, so proceed to the enclosing environment, the global environment, which has the procedure. We create E2 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 1, `counter` is 1, and `max-count` is 6. In E2 we need to evaluate:

``` Scheme
(if (> counter max-count)
    product
    (fact-iter (* counter product)
               (+ counter 1)
               max-count))
```

Evaluating primitive operations, we recursively end up with:
- E3 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 1, `counter` is 2, `max-count` is 6
- E4 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 2, `counter` is 3, `max-count` is 6
- E5 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 6, `counter` is 4, `max-count` is 6
- E6 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 24, `counter` is 5, `max-count` is 6
- E7 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 120, `counter` is 6, `max-count` is 6
- E8 which applies `fact-iter` where `product` is 720, `counter` is 7, `max-count` is 6

In E8, since `counter` is more than `max-count`, the answer 720 is returned.
