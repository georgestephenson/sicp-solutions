## Exercise 3.14

In general, the defined procedure `mystery` will reverse the order of the given list `x`.

Given that `(define v (list 'a 'b 'c 'd))`:

```
v-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][/]
     v        v        v        v
    [a]      [b]      [c]      [d]
```

After evaluating `(define w (mystery v))`:

```
                             v--.
                                |
w-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][/]
     v        v        v        v
    [d]      [c]      [b]      [a]
```

`w` is the reversed list returned by `mystery`. During the first call to `mystery`, `v` is mutated by `set-cdr!`, so that the car remains as `'a` and the cdr becomes `'()`.
