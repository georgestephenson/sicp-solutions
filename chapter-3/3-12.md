## Exercise 3.12

### Value of `x` before the call to `append!`

The first time `(cdr x)` is called, the response is:

``` Scheme
(cdr x)
(b)
```

The box-and-pointer diagram for `x` is as follows:

```
             (cdr x)
              v
x-->[o][o]-->[o][/]
     v        v
    [a]      [b]
```

### Value of `x` after the call to `append!`

After `append!` is called on `x` the final pair of `x` is mutated. The `cdr` of the final pair becomes the list value of `y`. The result of `x` is the same as `w`:

```
x
(a b c d)
```

The result of `(cdr x)` will be:

``` Scheme
(cdr x)
(b c d)
```

The box-and-pointer diagram for `x` after mutation is as follows:

```
w-.         (cdr x)  y
  |          v       v
x-*>|o|o|-->|o|o|-->|o|o|-->[o][/]
     v       v       v       v
    [a]     [b]     [c]     [d]
```

We need to consider all of the mutations to understand the environment. Although `z` is defined as `(append x y)`, this does not mutate values like `append!`, so `z` does not impact the value of `x`.
