## Exercise 3.53

Describing the elements of the stream defined by:

``` Scheme
(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))
```

As the first argument of `cons-stream`, 1 is the first element of the stream.

`add-streams` produces the elementwise sum of two given streams.

The second element will be the first element produced by `(add-streams s s)`, which will 1 + 1 = 2.

The third element will be equivalent to doubling the second element of `s`, since we were adding two streams together, which is 4.

This pattern is that the number of streams and therefore 1s being added together doubles for each element in `s`.

Like the `scale-stream` example in the book, the procedure generates a stream of powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
