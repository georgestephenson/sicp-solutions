## Exercise 3.42

Since the `withdraw` and `deposit` procedures stay the same from when the account is created, it is also OK that they are serialised into a serialised procedure at the time the account is created.

Ultimately the procedures still get serialised every time they are called, and the definitions of `protected-withdraw` and `protected-deposit` do not need to change after the account is created.
