## Exercise 3.15

As illustrated in Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17, this is `z1` and `z2` before `set-to-wow!` is called:

```
z1->[o][o]
     v  v
    [o][o]-->[o][/]
     v        v
    [a]      [b]

z2-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][/]
      |        v        v
      |       [a]      [b]
      |        ^        ^
      *------>[o][o]-->[o][/]
```

This is the effect of calling `(set-to-wow! z1)`:

```
z1->[o][o]
     v  v
    [o][o]-->[o][/]
     v        v
    [wow]    [b]
```

This is the effect of calling `(set-to-wow! z2)`:

```
z2-->[o][o]-->[o][o]-->[o][/]
      |        v        v
      |       [a]      [b]
      |                 ^
      *------>[o][o]-->[o][/]
               v
              [wow]
```
