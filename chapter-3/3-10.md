## Exercise 3.10

The difference introduce by the modified version of `make-withdraw` is that there is an extra environment every time `make-withdraw` is called. Each call to `make-withdraw` creates an environment binding a value to `initial-amount`. The call to `let` creates a new environment binding a value to `balance` pointing at the previous environment. The frame enclosed by this environment runs the same code as the previous version of `make-withdraw`.
