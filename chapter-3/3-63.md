# Exercise 3.63

Original procedure:

``` Scheme
(define (sqrt-stream x)
  (define guesses
    (cons-stream 1.0
                 (stream-map (lambda (guess)
                               (sqrt-improve guess x))
                             guesses)))
  guesses)
```

Louis Reasoner's version:

``` Scheme
(define (sqrt-stream x)
  (cons-stream 1.0
               (stream-map (lambda (guess)
                             (sqrt-improve guess x))
                           (sqrt-stream x))))
```

In the first version, we are using a defined value `guesses`, so when we use `guesses` recursively, the first value is already known, the stream already exists.

In Louis Reasoner's version, although it produces the same result, we are calling another instance of `(sqrt-stream x)`, we will need to do another `cons-stream` and so on. The result within each stream is still memorised using `memo-proc`, but Louis Reasoner's version still needs to create many instances of the same stream and is less efficient.

Without `memo-proc`, Louis Reasoner's version is exponentially even worse, while the first version gets worse but not exponentially so.
